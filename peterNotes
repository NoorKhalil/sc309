look at mitochondrial genes in boht mito adn nuclei
fchecking for correlation between nuc and mito gene expression
In some cases there is coordination between them
synchronization is variable. There are gradients of external cues, like oxygen and de

fisson/fusion continuum. Some mitochondria are very efficient at respiration. When parts of thos3 mitos getg damaged, the balance goes towards fission. so oidativ damage does not spread. The damaged part can go mitophagy. Oxidative damage on a long mitochondria ccan snap off the bad part of the mitochondria.

There is a dynamic in the mitochondria.

We know all the genes in the mitochondria. We should write a script to pull out data from the set. If there are 20-30 genes (incluing TFAM in the nuc), we can write a script that extracts those.
