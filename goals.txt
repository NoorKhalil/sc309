The goal of our project is 

python equivalent of seurat call scanpy

it uses a different command structure.
If you are interested in single cell rna seq, you will use scanpy

biopython.org

bioconductor is a group of ???

take a look at bioconda. It is a channel for bioinformatics where you can search around for different tools.



Step 1: Identify public datasets. We will start with raw single cell RNA sequencing data.

Step 2: Run standard scanpy analysis

Step 3: Will run additional analysis based on expertise and compatibility of datasets
